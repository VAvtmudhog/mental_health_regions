crosswalks to assign Veterans to Mental Health Service Areas and Mental Health Referall regions

The excel file (zip_hsa_hrr_xwalk*.xlsx) contains multiple tabs.  The key tab is the last as it contains zip code, MHSA (mental health service area) and MHRR (Mental Health referral region).  Zipcodes roll up to counties, counties to MHSAs and MHRRs to MHRRs.   MHSAs were created based on where veterans received VA provided outpatient mental health care.  MHRRs were created bgased on where Veterans received VA provided inpatient (Residiential and Acute) mental health admissions.  This data is described fully in Gottlieb, Daniel et al, Psychiatric Services 2020, "Small Area Analyis of Veterans Affairs Mental Health Services Data"
